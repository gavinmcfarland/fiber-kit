title: Color Schemes
---

Color schemes are useful when a design alternates between blocks of colour because often when a background colour changes other colours much change to accomodate that color.

- `color` Applies the default colour theme
- `color-reverse` Reverses the background and text colours of the default color theme
- `color-constrast` Applies a contrasting color theme based on the default color theme.
- `color-<name>` Create your own color themes

<!-- ###### Example

```js
token: {
  color: {
    scheme: {
      default: theme(color.theme.light),
      light: {
        text: "",
        heading: "",
        link: "",
        code: "",
        block: "",
        border: ""
      },
      dark: {
        text: "",
        heading: "",
        link: "",
        code: "",
        block: "",
        border: ""
      }
    }
  }
}
``` -->
